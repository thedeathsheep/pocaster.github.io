 I was listening to the last episode of The Business of Videogames podcast by Shams Jorjani and Fernando Rizo (this is literally the best podcast for indies that nobody seems to know about), and they had Paul Kilduff-Taylor as a guest, the founder of Mode 7 who has been into gamedev for more than 20 years. On the podcast, he talked about an article he wrote a while ago where he laid out 42 tips on gamedev (title of the article is: 42 Essential Game Dev Tips That Are Immutably Correct and Must Never Be Disputed by Anyone Ever At Any Time!). During the podcast, he is pressed on some of the tips (e.g. the one on no genre is ever dead) and goes into more depth on why he thinks that way.
